# StayFrosty

A simple weather forecasting web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather, 5-day forecast, and hourly weather data for a given location. It also uses Leaflet.js for implementing a world map, allowing the user to select any preferred location.

## Directory Structure
- `weather_pics/`: Contains background images for different weather conditions.
- `StayFrostyApp/`: Contains the main app files (`index.html`, `script.js`, and split CSS files).

## How to Run
1. Open `StayFrostyApp/index.html` in a web browser.
2. Allow location access or search for a city to view the weather.
